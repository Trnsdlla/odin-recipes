<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Who doesn't love Oreos and Milk? This is a little guilty pleasure of mine.
    I try not to have too many, but it's a classic that I can always rely on.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk, any kind you like, although one of my favorite is Ithaca Cow milk. The cows are from New Jersey
            and the milk can be a bit creamy with a light yellow coloration, but oh it's so rich.
        </li>
        <li>Oreos, whether it be double stuffed or whichever. Can't go wrong with the regular one.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Just simply dip your Oreos into milk, letting it sometimes fall into the glass.</li>
        <li>Or just munch the cookie and chug the milk! :D</li>
    </ol>
