    <h1 class="sauce">Turkey & Pasta</h1>

<img src="../img/turkey-pasta.webp" height="420" width="330" alt="A bowl of mexican style pasta mixed with ground turkey and some pasta sauce. In the center is sour cream with sprinkled parsley over the dish.">

<h3 class="sauce">Description</h3>

<p> This dish is fantastic, I usually go with leaner turkey like 97/3 but it's your
    choice. The same can be said for the type of pasta, but I would definitely
    not go for spaghetti. Sour cream in the center to add some more flavor if thats 
    your thing (the greens sprinkled on top are for aesthetics).
